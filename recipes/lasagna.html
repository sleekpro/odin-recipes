    <h1>Lasagna Recipe</h1>
  <img src="./Lasagna.jpeg">
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    I used turkey in place of beef as I no longer am allowed to eat any beef, 
    pork--no red meat at all. I did everything else the same but without salt/pepper.
     Rarely use either of them. I loved it. Actually turned on my oven
      (a VERY rare thing as I am alone now.) Tasted great.

  <p>
    This is really good and it works exactly as written. If you don’t have mafalde pasta, 
    use lasagna sheets broken into pieces.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
    <li>½ (28 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
    <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
    <li>½ onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons dried basil (Optional)</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano (Optional)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

    <li>2 cups dried mafalda noodles</li>
    <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><h5>Step 1</h5>
        <p>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
        Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and 
        crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.
        Drain and discard grease. Add spaghetti sauce, tomatoes, onion, 
        garlic, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper.
         Cook over low heat until sauce is hot, about 15 minutes.</p></li>  
        <li>Step 2
        Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil.
         Cook mafalda noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 
         about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Step 3
        Add cooked and drained noodles to the sauce and stir until completely coated.
         Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
        
        <li>Step 4
        Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
        <li>Step 5
        Place skillet under the hot broil and cook until cheese is golden and bubbly,
         3 to 5 minutes.</li>
